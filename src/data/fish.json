These creatures inhabit freshwater rivers and are quite popular in aquariums. Despite their serene appearance, angelfish are known to be somewhat... territorial, particularly during breeding season. They are carnivorous by nature, feeding on smaller fish and invertebrates. Still, one can't help but admire their graceful beauty, even if one is more inclined towards fossils and the like."

        "description": "The whale shark holds many records for size in the animal kingdom, most notably being by far the most massive living non-mammalian animal. Whale sharks inhabit the open waters of all tropical oceans, so they are rarely found in water below 21 °C (70 °F). Their lifespans are estimated to be between 80 and 130 years. Whale sharks have very large mouths and are filter feeders, which is a feeding mode that occurs in only two other sharks, the megamouth shark and the basking shark. They feed almost exclusively on plankton and small fishes and pose no threat to humans."

        "description": "Blather: The triangular teeth of sharks appear to have evolved from scales sometime in the past. When a tooth breaks, it quickly falls out and a new one grows in, keeping them always in good shape for prey. Sharks can be fearsome creatures, able to smell blood from several miles away. They can even jump out of the water to catch prey, making them powerful predators. Contrary to their tough image, their bones are made of cartilage and erroneously used as health food."

        "description": "Blather: The hammerhead shark is a shark with a head like a hammer, which is what you'd expect. However, despite being sharks, they are actually fairly laid back, which is not what you'd expect. With their eyes positioned on the two ends of their 'hammer,' they can see in almost all directions. Oddly, their nose holes are located right next to their eyes on their hammer section. They have a number of small holes on the front and lower portions of their heads as well. These holes allow them to detect prey, even fish hiding below them and out of sight. While they eat a nice array of fish, it seems rays are their favorite source of food. Rays, beware!"
